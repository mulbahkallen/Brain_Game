Detection of acute intracranial hemorrhage and subtypes

RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection
Detection of Acute Intracranial Hemorrhage and it's Subtypes 

Modules 4 Project
The Project
Intracranial hemorrhage, bleeding that occurs inside the cranium, is a serious health problem requiring rapid and often intensive medical treatment. 
For example, intracranial hemorrhages account for approximately 10% of strokes in the U.S., where stroke is the fifth-leading cause of death. 
Identifying the location and type of any hemorrhage present is a critical step in treating the patient.

Diagnosis requires an urgent procedure. When a patient shows acute neurological symptoms such as severe headache or loss of consciousness, 
highly trained specialists review medical images of the patientâ€™s cranium to look for the presence, location and type of hemorrhage. 
The process is complicated and often time consuming.

Methods & Techologies Used
Descriptive statistics
Python Pandas

DICOM Images
All provided images are in DICOM format. DICOM images contain associated metadata. 
This include PatientID, StudyInstanceUID, SeriesInstanceUID,....  

What am I predicting?
Predicting whether a hemorrhage exists in a given image, and what type it is.

File descriptions
stage_1_train.csv - the training set. Contains Ids and target information.
stage_1_sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format. Contains Ids for the test set.

Data fields
Id - An image Id. Each Id corresponds to a unique image, and will contain an underscore .
Label - The probability of whether that sub-type of hemorrhage (or any hemorrhage in the case of any) exists in the indicated image.
